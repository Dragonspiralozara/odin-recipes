    <h1>Chicken Burger</h1>
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You will be learning how to make a delicous chicken burger for a good old time.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hamburger buns</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ground chicken</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together the ground chicken, minced onion, breadcrumbs, egg, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper in a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li> Divide the mixture into four equal parts. I like using my kitchen scale for this step to get them exactly equal in weight, but you could 
            just eyeball it to save time. Shape each of them into patties.</li>
        <li>Press a divot into the center of each patty with your thumb. This helps prevent them from puffing up as they cook.</li>
        <li>Preheat a grill to medium heat (350F) or a large skillet over medium-high heat. Oil the grill grates with olive oil or add the 
            olive oil to the skillet and tilt the pan to coat it evenly. Cook the chicken patties until browned and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side or 
            until they reach an internal temperature of 160-165Â°F. (The temperature will continue to rise about 5 degrees as they sit for a few minutes.)To top 
            with cheese, place a slice on the patty during the last minute of cooking. Serve the juicy chicken burger patty on hamburger buns with your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
