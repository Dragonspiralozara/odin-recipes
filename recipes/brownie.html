        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You will be learning how to make a delicous brownies for a good old time.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chocolate chips</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Cocoa powder</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Vanilla</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pop the unsalted butter into a large microwave-safe bowl, and melt it in the microwave 
                in 20-second intervals. Stir between each interval to help prevent the butter from splattering. 
                The butter will be fully melted in about 2 minutes, depending on your microwave. Carefully remove 
                the bowl from the microwave (use oven mitts if the bowl is hot) and add the granulated sugar and cocoa powder. 
                Whisk vigorously for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add in the eggs, vanilla, and salt and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the all-purpose flour to the mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour in the chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Mix with a spatula until just combined.</li>
            <li> Lightly grease an 8×8-inch baking pan with baking spray and 
                line it with parchment paper. Spread the brownie batter into the prepared pan. Bake for about 35 to 40 
                minutes at 350°F. Insert a toothpick into the center to check doneness. For fudgy brownies, the toothpick will 
                come out with several moist crumbs, and for cakey brownies it should have just a few crumbs. Let the brownies cool 
                completely in the pan before slicing so they firm up nicely.</li>
        </ol>
